-1,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,Blouses
-1,This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.,Blouses
-1,"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",Blouses
-1,I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you  as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all  and while there is a bow in the back  the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review  but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top  not something special like the picture is o,Blouses
-1,I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,Blouses
-1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.,Blouses
-1,The quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide.,Blouses
-1,I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.,Blouses
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,Blouses
0,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel",Blouses
0,Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.,Blouses
0,This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.,Blouses
0,This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.,Blouses
0,This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.,Blouses
0,"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.",Blouses
0,"I loved this blouse  but had to return. i am 5'2""  127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy  which is fine  but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material  it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.",Blouses
0,I have mixed feelings about htis top  it is a nice shape and comfortable  fits triue t o size  but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs  3-dd chest).,Blouses
0,Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.,Blouses
1,I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer  it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online  it would,Blouses
1,I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho  flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!,Blouses
1,This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size  but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down  i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out  which is no big deal  but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall  it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.,Blouses
1,Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops  and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however  i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me  but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't,Blouses
1,I saw this top online  but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it  but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind  but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven',Blouses
1,"I'm petite and i ordered the smallest size possible online (5'1"" 95lb). i ordered the rain/umbrella pattern which is cute and very ""retailer"" in my opinion. for those who are experiencing ""gapping at the buttons over bust area"" - wear a tank inside and problem is solved! hoping they would come out with cuter prints in the future.",Blouses
1,I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite  but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso  but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.,Blouses
1,Great arm coverage  soft material  flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.,Blouses
1,I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it  so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!,Blouses
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,Dresses
-1,Ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans,Dresses
-1,And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see)  and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack,Dresses
-1,I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.,Dresses
-1,There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a,Dresses
-1,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,Dresses
-1,Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice  heavy knit-like material  but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.,Dresses
-1,The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.,Dresses
-1,Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.,Dresses
0,I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however  the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.,Dresses
0,I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug  but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.,Dresses
0,As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back,Dresses
0,It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec,Dresses
0,The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.,Dresses
0,I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.,Dresses
0,This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?,Dresses
0,I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7  115 lbs  wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish  but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately  when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester  and while it's machine washable (yay)  i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily  and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price  so i returned it.,Dresses
0,This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha,Dresses
1,"I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink  both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!",Dresses
1,This is stunning. it's almost snug for a 2 (i'm 5'6  123 lb) but that might be because it's strapless. it's constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one. i can't wait to wear this and i'm going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress. i feel like audrey hepburn in this.,Dresses
1,I saw this dress in store. at first i was not impressed because it was shapeless on but i added a belt and it was so much better. i styled it with my leather wrap around ada belt. looks great with a jean jacket or a leather jacket to make it look more chic.,Dresses
1,"Light and delicate and certainly not a color i would usually pick for myself but at sale price this was a lucky steal for me! if i had known how much i would love this dress i would've paid full price. as for sizing  i am top heavy but picked the smaller end of my size range instead of my usual. the slip is just about tts and the silk outer is larger and flowy. for fit reference: 5'3""  36dd  140#  barrel chested  large upper arms and i purchased size 8.",Dresses
1,Just fab. great length  great pattern  flattering fit  and even pockets!!,Dresses
1,"This is a great addition! it's comfortable  pretty  and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size  but bought the petite size  noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely  blue slip! such great quality for the price!",Dresses
1,This dress does run large  but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is  and is nicely flowy  but might require a slip.,Dresses
1,This dress is gourgeous  will be able to wear year round. just add a cardigan or blazer. the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide. however i have a hour glass shape  so my waist is very small,Dresses
1,I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice  a little heavier and more formal.,Dresses
-1,"I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8""  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov",Fine gauge
-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,Fine gauge
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor,Fine gauge
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,Fine gauge
-1,Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
-1,The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.,Fine gauge
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.,Fine gauge
0,This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!,Fine gauge
0,"Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).",Fine gauge
0,I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7,Fine gauge
0,I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color  but it was just unflattering on me.,Fine gauge
0,"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater  and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side  with 34g chest  155lbs 5' 5""  and the med was too big  (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type.",Fine gauge
0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5""  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",Fine gauge
0,Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.,Fine gauge
0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still,Fine gauge
1,I just purchased this adorable  unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it  i knew i had to have it! it is super soft  tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden  i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea,Fine gauge
1,I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber  2) it is ivory  not white and 3) although the fit is true to size  the sweater runs short  so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.,Fine gauge
1,I am a sucker for bows  so decided to try this one and ordered it. i went with the petite  without trying on the regular size (in hindsight  i should have ordered both)  but tit fit very nicely in petite  so keeping it. length is as on the model  right at hip  the colros of hte bow are well represented on the picture  light pink  light mustard yellow and navy  so i stil lthink it is neutral ebough to mix with other colors: warm or cold palette. love hte button detial in the back  i ordered xs an,Fine gauge

1,This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated  the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs  for a perfect fit. i went with yellow  which is a great color. this is not high low  which i love! i am so thrilled  that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review  i'm going to purchase another sweater in red.,Fine gauge
1,This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times  and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters  and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.,Fine gauge
1,This top is super comfortable and has a great preppy casual look. i have been wearing it on weekends with jeans  but could also pair it with a skirt and tights to have a more work type look. i don't usually like the shorter length shirts  but the fit on this works for me.,Fine gauge
1,This is such a classy  elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color  but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.,Fine gauge
1,"Great fabric and design  beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3"" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.",Fine gauge
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",Intimates
-1,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,Intimates
-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(,Intimates
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
1,I absolutely adore this set. it's beautifully constructed-- perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear. i normally wear a 32 c but got the 34 a/b and it fits perfectly. my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire  as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom. still  it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it.,Intimates

1,Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.,Intimates
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!,Intimates
1,I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.,Intimates
1,"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person  and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!",Intimates
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",Intimates
1,I love panties. i love the prettiest  softest  most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore  but these panties give me confidence  with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates  or the lovely lace colors will fade.,Intimates
1,Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach  but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.,Intimates
-1,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",Jackets

-1,While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was,Jackets

-1,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.,Jackets
-1,I ordered a small  but it was way to big. it was very soft.,Jackets
-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).,Jackets
-1,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.,Jackets
-1,I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.",Jackets
0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.,Jackets
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets
0,"This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the ""one size"" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.",Jackets
1,I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short  to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale  i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me  but i rolled them  which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.,Jackets
1,I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while. i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years. in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality. but not this little pilcro jacket. great quality  perfectly proportioned  great understated details. many thanks retailer for restoring my faith.,Jackets
1,I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine  but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but  i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me  still fitted at the waist (27inches)  but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.,Jackets
1,I initially ordered a small  but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like  even considering the style. (i was swimming in fabric!) i exchanged it for a petite small  and it fit perfectly. it goes so well with so many looks  and it is going to last a long while in my rotation. looks much better in person  too. my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received  this one had many threads loose throughout  which i clipped and think will be alright  but i expected,Jackets

-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,Jeans
-1,These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!,Jeans
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.,Jeans
-1,I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.,Jeans
-1,I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live,Jeans
-1,I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,Jeans

0,They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.,Jeans

0,I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r,Jeans
0,I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.,Jeans

-1,This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.,Knits
-1,This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!,Knits
-1,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.,Knits

0,This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.,Knits

0,At the beginning of summer  i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft  open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately  even though these are made of mesh  these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas  new york  new jersey  and florida. i thought they'd be a good  pretty choice. but  the material with the gathered waist & wrists  trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer,Knits

1,Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft  has a great shape  and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.,Knits
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Layering
-1,I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.,Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
1,"At 5'4"" and 140 lbs  this tank is a nice thin under layer. a little low cut for trying to cover cleavage.",Layering
1,I just bought the grey  and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!,Layering
1,"I'm 5'5"" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!",Layering
1,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,Layering
1,I love this shirt! it was a great price and very high quality. it has different material stitched in the inside,Layering
1,I bought it in black and cream! great weight. soft fabric. beautiful lace.,Layering
1,I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style  feel  and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price  but wish i had one is every color!,Layering
1,I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes  size up,Layering
1,This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.,Layering
-1,"These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",Legwear
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.,Legwear
-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!,Legwear
-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,Legwear
-1,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.,Legwear
-1,I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,Legwear
-1,Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,Legwear
-1,I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.,Legwear
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,Legwear
0,I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.,Legwear
0,I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.,Legwear
0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,Legwear
0,I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.,Legwear
0,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.",Legwear
0,"I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.",Legwear
0,These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.,Legwear
0,I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however  the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.,Legwear
0,I carry my weight on my lower half  usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.,Legwear
1,These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all  not overly long  subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer  and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too  i'm so happy with these!,Legwear
1,Fun socks you will want to show off. design is printed on a relatively thin (trouser sock).,Legwear
1,I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality  thick enough to feel appropriately covered  and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!,Legwear
1,I have 9.5-10 size feet  and these are a bit small; the heel doesn't quite make it around my heel to where it's supposed to be. still  they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors  and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.,Legwear
1,Great tights with good color and quality. i got a lot of compliments on my head to toe retailer ensemble!,Legwear
1,These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.,Legwear
1,I'm about 130 lbs. and 6' tall and usually a small would be my size. these fit  but i would be more comfy in a m. they are stretchy  soft and opaque. perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer!!! will be re-ordering.,Legwear
1,These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini  denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l,Legwear
1,I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings  plus fleece. instead  they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm  though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them  but not what i was hoping for  either.,Legwear
-1,So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti,Lounge
-1,Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!,Lounge
-1,The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously  seriously see-through.,Lounge
-1,Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.,Lounge
-1,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,Lounge
-1,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",Lounge
-1,These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way,Lounge
-1,This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,Lounge
-1,I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper  the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper  so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper  i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???,Lounge
0,I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.,Lounge
0,I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.,Lounge
0,Great print  terrible quality. the material is paper thin. not at all what i look for in a robe. it's going back.,Lounge
0,Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.,Lounge
0,I wanted to love this. the fabric and design are very nice. unfortunately - on my petite frame it looked like a lampshade. this would be very pretty on taller girls. for reference  i am 5'3 117 34b.,Lounge
0,I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.    i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p,Lounge
0,While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.,Lounge
0,I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy  yet unshapely. after the initial wear  the product begins to stretch out  and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft  but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely  but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a,Lounge
0,This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front  which fit nicely  but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps  i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!,Lounge
1,"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however  the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!",Lounge

1,I ordered my usual size small. i din't notice any fit problems after taking a quick look in the mirror the first day i wore them to my muscle training class. (this garment is more skin revealing than i really like  but i need to stay cool in the summer heat.) during the work-out i noticed that the leg edges of the shorts showed fat bulges; this was ugly  embarrassing  and unnecessary since i do not have overly fatty legs. later i noticed that the low-waist line of the shorts showed bulging fat a,Lounge
1,I love this cardigan! its fit  however  really depends a lot on an individual's height and build. i am about 150 lbs. i have slim arms and am larger in the chest. my typical size in retailer clothing is m. having said that  i found that in this top a s fit best. it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay. the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed. wearing leggings or slim pants (ex. pilcro cords) gave a much more flattering look to my backside. jeans...not so muc,Lounge

1,Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,Lounge
1,I found this top to be very beautiful and well made. the fabric is on the lighter side  however for me that is a double plus. it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top. and going towards spring it extends wearing time. the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater. it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities. i found it runs very true to size. i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t,Lounge
1,I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well  and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer  i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back  so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders  but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu,Lounge

0,I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!,Outerwear
0,This vest doesn't have a button  so i thought i could put my own. but when it arrived  it just didn't fit that well. the opening in the front is too big  the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere. i don't know  why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening  how is one supposed to keep warm at all?,Outerwear

0,I'm usually a 12  or size l in retailer and when i tried this on  buttoning it up from the bottom  i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined  which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy  and a good length - many trenches are too short  or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i,Outerwear
0,Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,Outerwear
0,Initially  i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.,Outerwear

1,Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it's a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it's lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there's the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it's lined. although it's so cropped  i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that's longer.,Outerwear

-1,I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other,Pants
-1,I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l,Pants
-1,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.,Pants
-1,"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14  i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size.",Pants
-1,I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful,Pants
-1,Based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however  the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.  they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo,Pants
-1,I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,Pants
-1,"I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70  but i think if i saw it in person first  i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute  the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels  necklace  armful of bangles  you can probably distract from the fabric.     5'5""  120lb  purchased xs and it's a little big still.",Pants
0,Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.,Pants
0,Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.  they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh,Pants

0,This jumpsuit is gorgeous...on the right body. if you have a tiny rib cage and a flat stomach and an average to short torso  this may fit you beautifully. on me  the defined gathered area you see in the photo was very tight and hit me in an odd place. the fabric is a great weight and it is a beautiful and rich looking. i really wanted this to work out for me. as for size  i found it just a little tight in the hips  waist and rib cage.,Pants
0,"I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3"" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be",Pants
0,I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.,Pants
0,I had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit. i'm normally a 10-12  preferably a petite. i ordered this in a large and i couldn't begin to zip it up. it also ran extremely short in the crotch area. very pretty print but it's going back!,Pants
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",Pants
0,It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water  line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water,Pants
1,I was on the fence about ordering my normal med  but so glad i did. it fits sooo well. i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin. its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels. i don't like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath. this was a great buy especially with the sale.,Pants
1,"I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small  however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of ""i need to borrow that from you""! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4"" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!",Pants
1,"I have shirts and dresses from this brand  and they are great. i was happy to finally see a pair of pants! these are just as soft and well made as the other items. i would recommend you try them on. there is only a slight variation from one size to the next  so it will depend on what look you are going for. they are cropped at the calf  but can be ""pulled up"" for a more dressier look. i cannot say enough about the material. it is so soft and comfortable. they do wonders for your behind- i think",Pants
1,Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.,Pants
1,"These are very versatile pants. you can pair them with a tank top and flip flops and be ready for a casual summer day or pair them with a dressy top and heels and be ready for a formal function. i've only worn these once to a formal city function and felt put together and comfortable. with the pants i wore a black lace button up top  satin peep toe heels  black tuxedo jacket and a chunky necklace...very cute. my husband loved it. i'm 5'3""  117 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. they only downside to",Pants

1,The fit  the length  the color  the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in  and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so  so  beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.,Pants

1,"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10"")  but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",Pants
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,Shorts
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man,Shorts

-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts

0,Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.,Shorts

1,I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper.  i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item.,Shorts
1,I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall  110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.,Shorts
1,I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,Shorts
1,I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors  so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise  nice shorts for the price.,Shorts
-1,I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.,Skirts
-1,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,Skirts
-1,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6""  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.",Skirts
-1,This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.,Skirts
-1,Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!,Skirts
-1,I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous  it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back.,Skirts
-1,I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.,Skirts
-1,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",Skirts
-1,Then this one is for you! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt  as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale. based upon the pictures  i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail  but it is actually masking this skirt's ugly secret:  a pouch. yes  it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen  which does not lay flat. the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots.                 this one,Skirts
0,Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape  very flattering. however  the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...,Skirts

0,Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!),Skirts
0,It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .,Skirts

0,The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.,Skirts
1,Fits pretty true to size  thick material  sits nicely.,Skirts
1,I love this brand and the 8 fits perfect. i am typically an 8 in retailer skirts and this is no exception. medium to heavy weight soft denim which is more of a darker denim shade with a wide a-line cut. the pockets are distinct and give the skirt character. it is pretty long and full looking on my 5'4 inch height. i purchased this on sale plus promo and very happy i was able to receive it as it became a sold out style in my size. the hem is a wide stitch hem and gives it a nice look. i look forwar,Skirts
1,Well made. color is great  goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee  denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.,Skirts
1,I love this skirt  wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size  which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.  anyway  ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight  like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist  so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute,Skirts
1,This is a good basic casual skirt  and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts  but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8  which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though  even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy  and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.,Skirts

1,I love it. the fabric is a heavier denim and it has a nice stretch. being tall i appreciate the length. the sizes run a bit large; i'm usually a 10/12 but the 8 is perfect.,Skirts
1,I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also  the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference  i'm 5'5  34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still  i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.,Skirts

-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,Sleep
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,Sleep
-1,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what,Sleep
-1,I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.,Sleep

-1,I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair  but i found the quality to be disappointing :(,Sleep

-1,The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.,Sweaters

1,This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style  and as others mentioned  there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath  or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.,Sweaters

-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,Swim

-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,Swim

0,I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
0,The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.,Trend
