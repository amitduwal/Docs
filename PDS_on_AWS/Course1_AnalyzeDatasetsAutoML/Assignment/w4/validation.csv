__label__1 "i love this shirt it 's easy to belt . i just wish it was tighter ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress . it is super soft and flattering for my body type ( petite and curvy ) . though i wish it did come in petite as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better . but that did n't stop me from purchasing as that 's an easy alteration . very flattering . love it ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer 's recent 20 % off sale . i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night . they both seemed to be just what i was looking for . i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular as i am usually in between sizes . the 4 was definitely too small . the 6 fit technically but was very ill fitting . not only is the dress itself short but it is very short-waisted . i am only 5 ' 3 but it fe"
__label__1 "i ordered the cream . the fabric is unique . similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality . you definitely need a cami or tank underneath . its form fitting without being too snug . i like to wear it with distressed jeans front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle ( my trouble spot ) with chunky accessories belt necklace and a block heel . it 's a little pricey but decided worth it ."
__label__-1 "this is quite an odd dress . it does wrap and is beautiful material . however the dress does not close at all in the chest area . i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono . it will go back for sure ."
__label__1 "i purchased this shell in black . the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality like as shown . i am 5 ' 4 120 # and typically purchase an xs . this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews but i am overall happy with the top . the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust ."
__label__-1 "this sweater was just okay . i am happy to pay $ 100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy and not the quality i expected for that price . i may have kept it if it were at about half the price but it just was not worth it . retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less . i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer . looked great in the photos but unfortunately in person were not quality garments ."
__label__-1 "this shirt fits very closely to the body . it has a very strange fit in the shoulder though . the arms themselves are really long far past my hands yet it 's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area . for reference i am 5'10 130 pounds and ordered a small which is what i usually need ."
__label__-1 "this is a cute dress but not for me . 1. i think it runs very small 2. it is super textured so if you do n't want to add bulk ( aka pounds ) to your frame this probably is n't for you . it 's too bad it 's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first . i 'm sure it 's probably adorable on smaller thinner people . unfortunately mine is going back ."
__label__0 "yes this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25 % off . it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day . it 's true to size : i 'm 5 ' 6 150 lbs and m fit well ."
__label__1 "this dress stunning for the hourglass figure . the hips may be a little narrow . i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best . i read some reviews that said the hips were snug . it 's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering . shoulders are a little loose and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest . i 'm 5 ' 4 32dd waist 27 and 130 lbs ."
__label__0 "i was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived . the fabric on the back is thin and clingy . i think you 'd have to wear a slip underneath . cute design on the front but sadly it 's going back ."
__label__0 "just a warning . i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on . if you do n't have a super tiny upper waist this wo n't fit well . too bad because it 's super cute if a bit sheer ."

__label__0 "got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black . quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat . a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down . not worth full price ."
__label__0 "my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around ( not all the way ) you can see the pin in the back . that should have been a clue that this dress is n't meant to fit anyone properly if it does n't fit the model . i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long . you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr"

__label__-1 "i want to love this shirt i really do but it 's huge ! the top is tent-like which would be adorable with skinny jeans however the length of the back dips so low the top kind of reminds me of pajamas . the color is beautiful more like a light grey heather and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material . overall the top is cute but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front . sadly it 's a return ."

__label__-1 "i bought this top and it ran huge i had to get an extra small . well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly ! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it ! i 'm so sad i really liked this top .... but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable ."
__label__1 "fun top for day or evening ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off . they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down . ( i usually wear a 28 or 29 and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs . ) unfortunately the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray . and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion . i will be returning them ."
__label__-1 "from the photos i thought the design was embroidered . in reality it is stamped on . there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric . i did n't feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it . the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual . i was disappointed it did n't work out ."
__label__-1 "this should have been cute but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering ."

__label__0 "this shirt had everything going for it - the cut the length the fun texture but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through . i do n't want to have to wear another shirt underneath . this one is going back . definitely not a swing but still cute ."
__label__-1 "i have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago . i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress . the fit and style of this dress is wonderful it 's the color that killed it for me . i ordered the orange because i liked the photo on the model . when the dress arrived in the mail i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on . the color is almost neon orange . too much for this redhead . hard to wear that bright neony color . not sure"
__label__0 "i love the idea of ruffles but this shirt was huge ! i normally wear a small or medium and i got the small . it felt more like a large to me . maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes it will work out for you . i 'm going to take it back rather than exchange . i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer but it 's pretty thick ."
__label__1 "pretty delicate lace top ... love it ! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips ."

__label__1 "i bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces . the top is amazing ! it is soft great fabric a cute cut and can be styled in so many ways ! definitely worth the buy !"
__label__-1 "did n't work on this curvy gal . sizing up would have helped with the button gaps but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size . major pass ."
__label__0 "definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt . just too large ; too much fabric for me . i 'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod . i would n't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top . i think the colors are also a bit duller in person . love the concept though !"
__label__-1 "i love everything about this except the length . i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me . the quality is good thick and substantial color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well . just weird proportions so sadly going back ."
__label__1 "my preference is clothing made of natural fibers but i could n't resist trying this on once i felt it ! the cut-out pattern in the fabric the color the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i 'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night . it 's perfect for southern california fall ( & likely much of winter this year ) weather . i 'm a 32d ( & wo n't need/wear a bra ) & although i usually wear a 6 i bought a 4. maeve i like your style !"
__label__1 "i ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly . i love the simple yet girly look of this top . the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch . it looks even better in person than in the pictures . the material is very soft and comfortable . looks great with jeans and flats or boots !"
__label__0 "the design of this dress is darling and so unique and it 's very well made . but i agree it 's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame . i 'm 5 ' 3 and ordered the 2 and it was like wearing a hospital gown . if a petite were available i 'd have tried that but this one 's going back . shame too because it 's adorable . the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut but that 's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these a size up because i 'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size . my pre-pre baby size ( chubby phase ) were size 8/29 . these fit like a size 4. way too small . very disappointed !"
__label__1 "the material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky . i think this dress is true-to-size or maybe runs a little bit big but only by a little bit . i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants . the dress hugs nicely on the upper body ( arms chest ribs ) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area . it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps . the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha"
__label__0 "beautiful pattern and shape ! however i had to send it back ! it is extremely see through and ran very small ! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area ! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better !"
__label__0 "this top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly . it still fits but something to be aware of ."
__label__1 "following another reviewer 's advice i ordered up to an xl . it 's huge . stick with your normal size or go down one . it 's a one of a kind piece . soft lightweight yet cozy and adorable . sadly have to return mine ."
__label__1 "fell in love with this romper online but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large i wanted to try it on in the store . this romper is even better in person ! extremely flattering delicate details and lined ! it 's adorable ! i am glad i tried it on in the store . i am usually a size 6/medium but the small worked better for me . i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer ."
__label__0 "oh how i wanted this skirt to work .... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful . the style is very nice . the knit is comfortable . but ... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away . after wearing it for an hour the front slit was curling in weird directions . the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y . i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips ."
__label__0 "i am so sad that this romper did n't work out . it 's just way too billowy and huge . i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small . i 'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper ! might look best on taller girls . i am 5 ' 2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent . do not recommend . such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me . it also clings tightly to the body . i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders ."
__label__-1 "i love the colors and style of this poncho however the fabric is a total miss . it is so scratchy i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it . also unfortunately the fabric is not woven tightly so the poncho does not keep you warm the wind whips right through it . it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill . i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back ."
__label__0 "ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs . i liked the length and overall fit of the xs however i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped . the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked . overall it ? s not a terrible vest but just not for me ."
__label__1 "love the material ( more natural fiber than synthetic ) the pattern and the colors . also it is cozy ! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long . so long that it may be a show-stopper . on the fence about that ."

__label__1 "i like these pants . they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me . my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture . the print is what drew me to these pants . the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received . they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i do n't think they would be worth it at full price ."

__label__1 "although this is not my husband '' s favorite ( he prefers things a little more tailored ) . i absolutely adore this ! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors . i just ordered the blue . i loved the way the size small fit ( not as wide ) but the medium for my height ( 5 ' 7 ) fit better and was longer . if i want to wear it as a dress i could . i highly recommend this ! ! well made and looks great ! ! !"
__label__1 "i agree with the other reviewer -- this is classic retailer old-style quality . the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical . the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist . i usually choose s/m in cardigans ( for ref 5 ' 8 135 lbs 34-b ) but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me . i think it just depends what you are looking for . unique it is and certainly lovely ."

__label__0 "i liked it online but i did n't want to pay shipping for something i was n't sure if it is good . when i saw one size 4 in the store i was excited to try it on . however it did n't quite meet the expectation . the dress fits a little loose ( donna morgan size 2 fits me better ) and it is not lined at all . the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape . there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller . i love the blue floral print but that is the o"

__label__1 "these pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy . the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants . there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well which i like ."
__label__0 "i really like this shirt but it 's a bit maternity . i do n't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here . i 'm 5 ' 7 about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret . since i 'm done having kids it has to go back . it 's also somewhat see through and had i kept it i would have worn a tank top underneath . as long as these things do n't bother you it really is cute !"

( i 'm 5'10 165lbs with a pear shape ) . after only three months of occasional wear ( about once a week at most ) and following wash instructions perfectly they started deteriorating . the pockets are becoming unsewn the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch and the bottom hem is coming unraveled . these are the most low-quality horrible pants i 've"

__label__-1 "bought this cami/tank on sale which i 'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted .. it kinda just drapes under the cami ... the problem is it 's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ... but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest .. so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment ... it simply looks awkward ... not sure if it would 've been better"
__label__-1 "i love the pattern adn color combo but wow t really flatering on me . too much fabric . i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu . anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me ... too bad . length was decent in regulat size though not too long . just too wide ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."

__label__0 "this is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger a nice blue and a good transition piece . but the upper arms are so tight on me ! i 'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin but not large either . i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it but sadly i just do n't think the material will be very forgiving . if you have truly thin arms i think it would be a great top . maybe sizing up would also work but for me at least i think it"

__label__1 "i 'm very picky about jumpers and this one is abolutely perfect ! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance . it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have i sized down because of the armpit area . nude garments and you 'll be fine . this is going to sell out fast do n't wait for it to go on sale ! ( seriously my store is already out of xs 's )"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful top however my top did not match the one in the picture it 's so odd the stripes are completely different it 's ok because it 's very pretty but i do like the one pictured better . it 's too short on me for leggings and boots but it 's great with skinny jeans . very pretty and soft material ."
__label__-1 "i have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events . this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality . however the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding . the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly but the fabric had no give . it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa . for the price i expected better . the color and style of the dress is gorgeous so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer . . ."
__label__0 "already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt . great fun shape very flattering . however the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down ( you can literally feel it through the liner and i 'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it ) . very poor attention to details ..."

__label__0 "usually i am a huge meadow rue fan but not this time . the print is okay but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft . if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt but since it was neither it was returned ?"

__label__0 "the skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach . you ca n't really tell from the pic . but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut . i 'm pretty slim - 5 ' 5 '' and 114 pounds and it was n't doing me any favors ! the top of the dress is beautiful ! i will exchange it for something else . i ordered it online and could n't try it on before purchasing it ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this top but had 2 major problems with it . first it 's not for short girls . i 'm only 5 ' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise . the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt which was terribly unflattering . second the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking . no regrets on returning this one ."
__label__1 "i have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store . it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it ! i absolutely love the fit -- it 's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality . i 'm typically a medium sometimes large -- i bought the medium and it 's perfect . i could have gone down to a small as well . the large was way too big ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 8 athletic 150lbs ) . this top is going to take me everywhere this summer ! worth a try !"

__label__1 "i was looking for a romper for a long time which i do n't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax . because of its design with a line on the top no worries for a relaxed romper . the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight ."
__label__1 "loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i 'm not a fan of . mine was mostly cut from the mum/sunflower patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern . the shirt online as a good combo of patterns -- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print ! way overboard ! ! that said -- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail -- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic !"

__label__-1 "i ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design . when it arrived i thought it was a cute different top uniquely designed . when i tried it on it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering . it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice . unfortunately it did not work for me . i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect"
__label__1 "this an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it . i 'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material . i would n't want to discourage anyone from trying it ."

__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and extremely well made ... if you can get into it . the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back . it 's form fitting so you 'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand . i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but it 's soooo form fitting i 'm afraid i would n't wear it ."
__label__-1 "when i tried this top on i started laughing . the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton which instead of falling by the hips juts out like wings . it 's also huge . cute idea wrong material and placement ."

__label__0 "wish i 'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut ' to look hippie-casual . i 'm taking this back with great regret . it 's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color ; made for a cool summer look . i do n't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes . sigh . it 's soft true fit and beautiful . i 'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it was n't for the 'cuts .

__label__0 "i am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear . i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons . when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big . the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day . it 's definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top . it 's going back ."

__label__0 "this is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house . i 'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it 's a bit scratchy around the edges . i was going to buy another color if i loved this but as it is i will keep the one"
__label__1 "love this blouse . the owl design is flawless front to back . the material has a silk like feeling . i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer . if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you . also i am a 38 c and the chest fit well ( in size large ) but would not offer much more room for a larger chest . if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows i would size up . i love the unique design !"
__label__1 "this blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great . silk is always light and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt . i 'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks ."
__label__1 "i do n't own any peach outerwear because i did n't think it would complement my skintone . this cozy bomber proved me wrong . wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that 's eye catching . great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe . this is not a fitted style it 's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist just like a regular bomber jacket . i chose medium petite and it fits just right . i 'm a 36d 135 # 38-28-35 ."
__label__0 "i absolutely love the fit of these jeans ! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips . they are fitted and look nice with boots but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material . legging material while comfortable typically feels thin but these do not and they are quite warm . the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs . i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them ( and have hang dried them ) about 4 times . i have neve"
__label__1 "i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long ( they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered ) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size . i love it ! it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt . so cute with skinny jeans and leggings ! it is one of my favorite fall tops ! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays !"

__label__1 "i love this vest and could not leave without it . the color and lining just make it perfect so stylish and comfy ! i 'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect . the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down . i am big on the bottom the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest ! love love ..."
__label__1 "love this dress ! the color is gorgeous ! what you do n't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress . i received so many compliments when i wore this dress . the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight . you can wear this dress year round . i love these kind of dresses ! retailer knows how to do this right ! love this store !"
__label__0 "yes it 's a swing top just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season . i find this silhouette unflattering on me being top heavy so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house . it also runs huge with big gaping arm holes . the sleeves are cute and fluttered . the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer . it is a pretty boxy top which the photo does n't seem to capture . order at least a size smaller than usual ."
__label__1 "i am so glad i did not wait to order this dress . the fit is great and is made with great material . i am 5 ' 7 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress . the length falls right at my knee . it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit . a very cure feature . the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice ."
__label__0 "this top does sit weird feels like a circus outfit ... but at the same time its unique in its own way . i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down probably because of the way this top is styled . i 'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway . material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton ."
__label__0 "i liked this top i really did . i also liked the subtle shimmer . the fabric did n't seem as soft but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back . you can see it on the model here but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just did n't look right . asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large but here it is . the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader . i am sending it back ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 7 125lbs and the small fits perfectly . the sleeves are the right length ( i have long arms and legs ) and the body fits loosely without looking sloppy . at my height the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic which is fine . unfortunately the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt so i had to wash it before wearing it . i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale ."
__label__1 "so pretty . 5 ' 4 115 lbs and the xs fits perfectly ."
__label__-1 "i love good flowy blouses and like the over sized look but this one did n't wow me . i thought the quality was just ok. it did n't flatter me . i almost liked it but i did n't . i 'm glad i tried it on because looking at the pics online i thought i 'd like it way more than i did . just not great ."
__label__0 "slouchy relaxed fit . well sewn together and hangs well on the body . bottom hem hits upper thigh . good length and soft easy fabric . light layering option as well . good spring jacket can be kept on indoors without getting too hot ."
__label__1 "i saw this shirt in store a while ago but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it . however when it went on sale and there was an extra 40 % i decided to get it . i like the top it 's cute and fun . however it does poof out a little in the midline . this top goes great with jeans or shorts and it is cute but definitely not worth full price for this ."
__label__-1 "this top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types . i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips ... will be returning ."
__label__1 "the picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like . the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color . it looks great on and the colors compliment each other . i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe ."
__label__1 "this duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight . i 'm not sure it 's worth this price point but it 's not cheaply made either . the colors are as shown on the website to a 't ' . the length is also as shown . i am 5 ' 5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect . i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect . colors are dark teal salmon and gold . this is a three seaso"
__label__-1 "this dress fits awfully . it 's not short as pictured in photo . it hit just above my knees . it looked like sack . i would 've also felt like i was choking all night with it clasped around my neck . it potentially may look okay on someone who is very tall skinny and lanky but i have my doubts about that too ."
__label__1 "i ordered these in the pinkish color and i love them ! i 'm 5 ' 8 140 lbs . and the size small fits perfectly . they are definitely sheer but they 're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected . these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini bandeau or even tankini . the price is great especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms . no pockets is the only negative ."
__label__0 "i really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste . it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger . really cute style just not sure it 's worth the price . great colors though ."

__label__-1 "bummer i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen . seriously looks maternity to me . the neck is also too wide . the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just did n't work on me . i returned this one ."
__label__1 "this is the most beautiful dress ever ! i 'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest . this dress feels like it was made for me . i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming . i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest . the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made . while the lining might be too short for tall girls being only 51 the lining is perfect . the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"

__label__0 "i loved this dress ... until i washed it . the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry ... which i did ( washed on delicate ) . now it 's not the same dress . it 's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it . i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved . just kind of annoyed . so it 's an awesome dress just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it ."
__label__1 "first i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread . i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic but actually i 'm glad i did n't know because i love it . it does not look cheap and it really works . the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough . the real issue for me is the size . i ordered the small and it is huge . enormous . especially from the back . the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it 's almost a bat wing kind of thing and"

__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that did n't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness . i mean for the price should n't it be lined or something . when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low . but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i ca n't really complain too much . plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off . i gave up at that"

__label__0 "this is such beautiful material but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i 'm wearing shoulder pads . that structured element compared to the rest of the dress ( relatively unstructured ) just looks ridiculous . i was so looking forward to this dress and now it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "one ca n't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent . it also is very long almost dress length . feels less quality than what retailer usually carries ."

__label__0 "i lived the front and back designs but did n't like the fit ."
__label__0 "overall the dress is beautiful easy and great quality . but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo if that makes sense . it 's not poofy or super-layered but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here . besides that bottom part the fit is true to size . but as a petit the extra fabric is n't what i 'm looking for . i think it works depending on what you 're looking for . beautiful though !"

__label__0 "so the dress is interesting . has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length ( i 'm 5 ' 3 and the petite barely covers my assets ) and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging . but the shoulders are what make it look matronly . they 're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm . they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish . i looked back"
__label__0 "i 'm an xl in retailer tops and the xl fit as expected in this blouse . however the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering . the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume . i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse . the blouse is a good quality but there were too many other issues for me to keep it ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide short and crooked . after it was washed once it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong ."

__label__1 "this piece is gorgeous in person . it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything ... it is more of a coat than a sweater . i bought one for my mom and picked one up for myself when it went on sale . it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection ."
__label__0 "i really like the style of this top and it 's delicate but well made but i wish it were longer and less boxy . it 's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer but the cami is very cropped . when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff ( and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary ) . a longer cami probably would n't work because the top is also very short . i 'm 5 ' 0 '' with an average torso length and ordered the xxs petite . also you would have to cut the tag off if you d"

__label__-1 "these are light and airy and pretty . they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed . they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them ... or turn over in bed in them . when i sit the slits fall down around my thighs . my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way"
__label__0 "this coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner . the style is very classy and timeless . it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear . yes it does run large but that is the cozy look of it . it is not meant to be form-fitting . my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it 's not going to be especially warm it should at least be otherwise functional . the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside but they are sewn shut . a coat without pockets ?"
__label__0 "i was really pulling for this dress to work because it 's beautiful however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return . it 's much higher on the model than in real life . the petite length was still far too long so additional hemming required otherwise fit was true to size ( 5 ' 3 130 lbs size 6p )"

__label__0 "i love the pattern ( red motif ) but the sizing of this dress is way off . the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart . the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching . i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5 ' 9 170 # bra size 34f and 40-41 hips ."

__label__-1 "i grabbed my typical size ( 8 ) and found it fit snug in the bust . the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front . it 's lowcut but i did n't feel particularly exposed . i ended up not buying it because i do n't think it fit my body right . the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole"

__label__-1 "the concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice . the inner layer is sheer but as long as you 're wearing a nude-colored bra no big deal . however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy . they must 've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top because it looks like it hangs straight on her . i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package it clearly flares out & is a-line . so as a previous reviewer stated it looks huge from the front . if it had fit the"

__label__-1 "i love the color of this top but the style is not flattering . i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive ! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide . bummer"
__label__0 "i was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party . it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail . the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric . it does n't look right . if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric like the main photo shown you are good . the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this shirt . i like the style the material is soft but it was so short on me . perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else . i was n't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short ."
__label__-1 "the skirt is comfortable and as pictured . it also ran tts . i 'm 5 ' 5 tall and weigh 140 lbs . i had the medium and did n't need to size up to a large . when you put the skirt on a normal body it looks like you are wearing an easter egg ... and not in a good way ."
__label__-1 "the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful ! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area . it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward ."
__label__-1 "i hate to be so negative but i ca n't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews . it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest . adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse . looks cheap ."
__label__-1 "if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful . the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage . recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look"
__label__0 "the sweater is very very warm . it looks okay not the best but not bad . i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i do n't wear sweaters and jackets without closures . i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder . so i am sending it back ."
__label__-1 "there 's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut . i ca n't move my arms in this dress . otherwise the fit was fine . the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds . other than that the does nothing for your figure . i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5 ' 1 . do n't buy it . i know it 's tempting with the sale price ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 3 about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all . i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6 but could tell that even if i had the 4 the cut of it still would n't be flattering on me at all . it was baggy in odd places and had no shape . the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice with a fitted slip design ."
__label__1 "love the colors ! love the stripes ! great shape ! great style ! but ... i am normally a 12 on top ... and this pulled across my back ... so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that ... i have a broad back . we will see how it fits ! but what an adorable shirt !"
__label__1 "the pictures of this sweater do not do it justice . i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store . the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch . zipper is cute . v-neck is just right - it is not too low . i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase ! i did n't see the pink or navy in the store ."
__label__-1 "i 'm returning this cardigan . it does n't fit me at all . it 's shapeless and loose ."
__label__0 "i 'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras so i was excited to try this one out . while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras the cups provided too much coverage for my style . if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt the top of the cup shows . bummer !"
__label__1 "i fell in love with this tunic on instagram and could n't wait to find it during the tops promotion . it was absolutely not a disappointment . as the other reviewer mentioned the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful -- they 're rich and fallish but not at all over the top . i 'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic . i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range -- i di"
__label__0 "this dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline . however only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain . the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump . needless to say i 'm returning it ."
__label__-1 "the small zipped and laid flat measures 16 across at the bottom of the armholes 11 at the waist and 18 from shoulder seam to bottom edge . it 's too small for a size 0 and not by just a little ! too bad because it really is very pretty ."

( if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it ) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed . it was reticketed and it did n't really feel brand new when it arrived"
__label__0 "i tried yellow motif but unfortunately i did not purchase it . it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me ... i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves . texture was ok. usually i like a cool touch of linen . but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen . i was not quite sure ; it just was not right for me . only word i could think was average . personally i do not recommend it but who knows maybe it is right for you ... so try wear"
__label__0 "i loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives . the grey color is drab yet leaves room for creativity . it 's stylish yet wrinkles horribly . i am 5 ' 2 so it hangs too low in the front and armpits . another reviewer mentioned the buttons yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest . the pockets are a great space for hands yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits so will not hold much . i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
__label__0 "other reviews are correct . but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering . makes legs look miles long . however this fits very tight allows no room for extra tummy hips booty or thighs . i ordered a s ( i 'm usually a 4 ) - was able to get it on ( step into it from the top ) but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was . if there was an m would have definitely sized up as i really liked the look ."
__label__-1 "huge ! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering ."
__label__0 "got this in the moss color . i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price . returned it because it was not cute on . the waffle fabric did n't stand out and the bottom just hung straight . i thought it would be more ruffle-like . even on sale i wo n't buy it ~ it 's just that blah"
__label__-1 "on me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu . it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size . the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming . i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier no joke . fabric is soft though . give it a try just not for me ... ref : 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."

__label__-1 "this dress makes me so sad ... the textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on . as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress . the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around ( too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut ) . basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes . it could have been so good but alas but t"
__label__-1 "way too much fabric ; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek ! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself ... the outer layer also does n't feel like it will breath . add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer . returning ."
__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__1 "i really love this shirt for its versatility . it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt or even jeans and heels . the shirt itself is super soft . it 's boxier than it looks in the picture but not to the point of crop-top . the shirt still hits at my hips ."
__label__-1 "this sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy . i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper . unlined and uncomfortable . no thank you ! should you choose to proceed i found the fit tts . i 'm 5 ' 8 wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me ."
__label__-1 "i totally agree with the last reviewer . i 'm 5 ' 2 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders . the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i could n't move my arms . the small was better but was too big in the torso . the material itself was really nice . too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me . i 'm usually fine with the petite sizing but this did n't work and i 'm so bummed . the dress is soft the blue color is gorgeous but it fits like a bag . i wanted to love this but sadly will have to return . i think someone with curves will love this dress . it is really beautiful quality just does not fit a petite frame ."
__label__1 "love this sweater ! not too long or bulky true to size . the fabric is super soft great quality !"

__label__-1 "this sweater is a lovely color and very soft . however the sweater 'sheds ' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance . it 's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through ."
__label__0 "this is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big ."
__label__-1 "just recently purchased and think it 's ok for the price . would never pay full on this one & that 's from an retailer shopper who 's purchased plenty at full price . design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly the pockets bunch up weirdly ( steaming/laundering do n't help ) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly . could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering did n't help that issue either ."

__label__0 "this top may be right for some but it did not work for me . i 've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one . however it did n't do much to flatter my body . i ordered the xl but it was huge . i 'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available . i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big . the quality is great and style so pretty though . i wish it had worked for me !"

__label__0 "i was so excited when this dress arrived today . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric is lovely soft and drapey and it feels great on . it felt great that is until i looked in the mirror . while the dress fit fine i have a large bust and the fabric stretched across the bust causing the print to appear washed out across the bust . not a good look . sigh . another return ."
__label__1 "i ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model ... not tight at all and very flattering . even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering ... makes my legs look long ! i am 5 ' 4 and about 118 # . the material is so soft and substantial ... the color is very accurately portrayed online . i ca n't wait to wear this fall !"
__label__1 "i love every other byron lars dress i 've bought and this was a no brainer for me . when it arrived i was really disappointed . the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick . with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does . nope . only the back buttons open . thick stretchy fabric and back buttons ... not an easy thing to navigate . i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m"

__label__1 "this dress is very soft and ultra comfortable . i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length even though i got the regular and not the petite ."
__label__-1 "ugh i hate that this did n't work ! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is ( the sides go way up on me ) . the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes !"
__label__1 "i am super happy with the t-shirt .... it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail ! ! i 'm thinking about buying another ! !"
__label__1 "in my opinion the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase . adorable cut and style comfortable and cute . it 's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans . love this !"

__label__0 "i think these are amazing for anyone over say 5 ' 5 . the way these hung on me ( at 5 ' 2 ) were very unflattering in the front . they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them . that 's all i can say without being crass ."

__label__-1 "wow ! this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body ! yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves . to me it seems like the material will wear well . i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure . it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs it wo n't work . i ordered the medium and am usually a small . the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy . i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas ."

__label__0 "this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline . but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area -- so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty . a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just did n't feel comfortable about . some darts could have made a nicer fit here . but this is a a great dress if you do n't mind a super body con fit ."

__label__0 "this spandex top in my opinion is workout wear . it is not the tank i expected to receive but my bad . it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts . it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is it should fit like this . 5 ' 5 142 lbs medium is skin tight . color is nice but as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer . quality seems fair ."

__label__0 "i 'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve . the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve but the sleeves do not fit loosely they kind of twist under the armpit area . i do not have large arms so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves but they do not fit right . i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline . it is messy and tacky looking but i think that is how it was meant to be . my recommendation to buy"
__label__0 "these pants are really beautiful . the material feels nice and i love the pull on style however they are much too long for me . i 'm 5 ' 3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos . i think if you are tall enough these are a wonderful piece ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type . also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me ."
__label__-1 "i followed the other reviews and sized down . normally i 'm a small/medium in retailer ( 5 ' 8/135 for clarification ) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy . i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i did n't have to pay rent on the romper given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it . oddly the arm-holes were normal sized ? i returned this mess ."
__label__0 "i 'm a size 28 jeans 5 ' 9 with a bubble bottom . these were falling off of me around the hips . these are warm . i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it . it does n't matter functionality wise because i never felt a draft . they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit ."
__label__1 "i just got this top and ca n't wait to wear it for spring/summer ! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably . it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely . this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side so trust me on this ! overall i highly recommend this top if you 're looking for a muted but unique comfy top for the warmer months ahe"
__label__1 "i love this shirt ! red + navy is one of my fave color combos and the vintage feel is fantastic . the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting but it 's a good thing . the top is n't heavy but the knit gives it more texture & interest . this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look ... covered but form-fitting and flattering ."
__label__-1 "very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall 120 lbs . i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top .. sadly returned the top . otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric ."
__label__-1 "i loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing . it fit really well and was flattering . the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry . the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places . the sleeves are now tight and way too short . the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches . the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open . i 'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is ."
__label__0 "i ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl . it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear . it also attracted so much lint . the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it . it added weight and was unflattering for my shape . the colors do match the photos online . the length also matches the model 's photos . it just did n't work for me ."
__label__1 "love this dress . great lightweight fabric bold colors and lined to the knee . the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth but it breaths well so it does n't add extra heat . i found it ran true to size and it 's a good length for tall girls . i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back . looks great on it 's own or dress it up with a statement necklace . there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement . great find ."
__label__0 "i absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe . unfortunately this particular product left a lot to be desired . firstly the fit is slim not relaxed . i 'm 5 ' 4 at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 ( equivalent of a small ) and size 2 ( equivalent of a medium ) . sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess . they both zipped up easily but did not drape well . finally the fabric was really not welcoming . i prefer terry over fleece however this w"
__label__1 "i was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter . this shirt looks great on its own but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests etc . it 's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality but it is holding up well so far ."
__label__1 "you make classy stuff . this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt . colors : ca n't tell from the picture but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed very fun and happy yet appropriate colors for fall and winter . the cut is very flattering the scallop part is interesting though it is sown at one part of the skirt in the middle not sure why . i ordered the 0p and that fit me like a glove . ( 26.5 in waist 35-36 in hips 115 lbs ) . length on the petite was above the knee like show"
__label__0 "first comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small which is not in line with most retailer pieces . i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close on top of being busty . the material is thin and mildly see thru but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top . i decided to keep it ."
__label__0 "cute stripes and soft but very pajama top like in feel/look ... like if you wear it out people will assume you 've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home ."
__label__-1 "disappointed the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant . even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs ."
__label__0 "when i saw this i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year . the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality ( would wash well ) but it 's pretty lightweight . the fit is huge ... could easily size down . i 'm 5 ' 7 128 # and found the small to be loose everywhere including the arms . the length was at my knees and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest . no idea what i 'd wear this with even if it fit better . sadly it 's going"
__label__0 "the sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body . i like the fabric ( nice and thick ) but it did not work for me ."
